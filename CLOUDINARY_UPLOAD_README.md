# Cloudinary Upload Guide

This guide will help you upload images to Cloudinary with exact filenames (no random strings) so they work perfectly with your React app.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment Variables

Edit the `.env` file and add your Cloudinary credentials:

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

**To get these credentials:**
1. Go to [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Copy your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret

### 2. Place Your Images

Put your motivational images in the `images/` directory. The script will automatically:
- Upload them to Cloudinary with exact filenames
- Place them in the `motivational` folder
- Use the correct naming pattern that matches your code

### 3. Upload Images

Run the upload script:

```bash
node upload-motivational-images.js
```

## 📁 File Naming Patterns

The script automatically converts your filenames to match what the code expects:

### FRASES Files (Items 1-50)
- **Your file:** `frases-21.jpg` or `FRASES_21.avif`
- **Cloudinary name:** `FRASES_21`
- **App item code:** `MOTIVATIONAL-21`

### MOTIVATIONAL Files (Items 51+)
- **Your file:** `motivational-023.jpg` or `MOTIVATIONAL_23.avif`
- **Cloudinary name:** `MOTIVATIONAL_023`
- **App item code:** `MOTIVATIONAL-23`

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Upload Single File

```javascript
const { uploadImageToCloudinary } = require('./upload-to-cloudinary.js');

// Upload with exact filename
await uploadImageToCloudinary('./images/frases-21.jpg', 'motivational');
// Result: Cloudinary public_id = "motivational/FRASES_21"
```

### Upload Entire Directory

```javascript
const { uploadDirectoryToCloudinary } = require('./upload-to-cloudinary.js');

// Upload all images from directory
await uploadDirectoryToCloudinary('./images', 'motivational');
```

### Upload Specific File Types

```javascript
// Upload only AVIF files
await uploadDirectoryToCloudinary('./images', 'motivational', ['.avif']);

// Upload only JPG and PNG files
await uploadDirectoryToCloudinary('./images', 'motivational', ['.jpg', '.png']);
```
